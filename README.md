## Development

* This application uses [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com) to provide the action bar for older Android versions. 

* Another dependency is the library [StickyListHeaders](https://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders) which helps adding nice list headers.

* The project needs the android-support-v4.jar to build. If your Eclipse doesn't find it on its own, you have to specify its path (it resides in your Android SDK folder as extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar) in the project settings > Java Build Path > Libraries (via "Add External JARs").

ActionBarSherlock and StickyListHeaders are added as git submodules. To fetch their content after cloning the repository, just execute:

```
git pull && git submodule init && git submodule update && git submodule status
```
